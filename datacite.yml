title: "Simultaneous fMRI/eyetracking while movie watching, plus visual localizers"


description: |
  "Extension of the dataset published in Hanke et al.
   (2014; doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.3) with additional acquisitions for 15 of
   the original 20 participants. These additions include: retinotopic mapping,
   a localizer paradigm for higher visual areas (FFA, EBA, PPA), and another
   2h movie recording with 3T full-brain BOLD fMRI with simultaneous 1000 Hz
   eyetracking.

   This is an extension of the studyforrest project, all participants previously
   volunteered for the audio-only Forrest Gump study. The datset is structured in
   BIDS format, details of the files and metadata can be found at:
